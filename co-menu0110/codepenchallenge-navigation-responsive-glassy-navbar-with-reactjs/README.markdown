# #CodepenChallenge Navigation: Responsive Glassy Navbar with ReactJS
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/takaneichinose/pen/abovwoB](https://codepen.io/takaneichinose/pen/abovwoB).

 Mobile-first responsive navigation menu design concept.

The structure of the links is just exactly the same as how I forked it. It is like, I just added some classes, and some elements, example for icons, or the text itself.

The menu and sub-menu was created with recursive function.

Resources/Libraries/Frameworks:
